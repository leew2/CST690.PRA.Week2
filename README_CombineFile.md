"create readme for CombineFile.py"

## Overview
This script combines multiple Excel files from a specified directory into a single Excel file. It is designed for use in Week 2 of the CST 690 100 Robotic Process Automation course.

## How It Works
- The script searches for all `.xlsx` files in the `Week 2/data/` directory.
- It reads each Excel file and appends its contents to a list.
- All dataframes are concatenated into one combined dataframe.
- The combined data is saved as `main.xlsx` in the same directory.

## Usage
1. Place all Excel files to be combined in the `Week 2/data/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   python Week 2/CombineFile.py
   ```
3. The output file `main.xlsx` will be created in the `Week 2/data/` folder.
**Note:** Ensure 'main.xlsx' is closed before running the script, or it will not work.

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```powershell
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

## Notes
- Only `.xlsx` files in the specified directory are combined.
- The output file will overwrite any existing `main.xlsx` in the folder.
